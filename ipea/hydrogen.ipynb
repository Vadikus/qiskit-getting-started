That's the problem we are trying to solve. And we will solve it using this algorithm known as Iterative Phase Estimation."

    "At this point, I will provide a peripheral explanation of what the algorithm essentially does. The detailed explanation will follow as I actually code the algorithm. Before I give the basic summary though, keep the following point in mind - \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT : We assume that $\\phi$, the value we are trying to find, can be expressed as $\\frac{\\phi_1}{2} + \\frac{\\phi_2}{4} + \\frac{\\phi_3}{8} + ... + \\frac{\\phi_n}{2^n}$. Here each of the $\\phi_k$'s are either 0 or 1. Another way of thinking about this key assumption is that $\\phi_1\\phi_2\\phi_3...\\phi_n$ is the binary representation of $2^n\\phi$ and $n$ is the number of iterations that we do \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the general working : as the name of the algorithm suggests, there will be several iterations. Consider iteration k. The goal of this iteration will be to determine $\\phi_{n-k+1}$ in the expression for $\\phi$ above. To do this, the algorithm uses a circuit with two qubits : an auxiliary qubit and a main qubit (typically, this would be true. In this notebook we use three qubits because the problem we are tackling requires it). What will end up happening in every iteration is that $U$ will be acted on the main qubit in such a way that the auxiliary qubit's state, upon measurement, will collapse into $\\phi_{n-k+1}$. Once we have all the $\\phi_i$'s we can just put them into the above expression and solve for $\\phi$."

Using the IPEA, we are going to obtain a very good approximate solution! You will see just how good our approximation is at the very end of the notebook. We are going to solve for the ground-state energy of the hydrogen molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we formulate this problem into an IPEA problem? Well, simple! The IPEA essentially tells you something about the eigenvalue of the unitary operator that you feed into it, right? So it comes down to smartly choosing the unitary operator that you use - if you feed in a unitary that, perhaps, has an eigenvalue related to the energy eigenvalue we wish to determine (remember that we wish to find the ground-state energy), then the IPEA can really help. What operator has an eigenvalue related to the enery eigenvalue of the hydrogen molecule? Well, that could be the controlled-$e^{-iHt}$ gate (our $U = e^{-iHt}$) where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule. This is essentially the unitary transformation we would use to time-evolve a wavefunction subject to the Hamiltonian of molecular hydrogen (recall that $\\left|\\psi(t + \\Delta t)\\right> = e^{-iH\\Delta t}\\left|\\psi(t)\\right>$). Since $H$, the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule, has energy eigenstates that correspond to energy eigenvalues (the ground state energy, first-excited energy for instance), the eigenvalues of the exponential of $H$ will be the exponentials of the energy eigenvalues (for the same eigenstates). More specifically, if $\\left|\\psi\\right>$ is an eigenvector of $H$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\alpha$, $e^{-iHt}$ satisfies $e^{-iHt}\\left|\\psi\\right>=e^{-i\\alpha t}\\left|\\psi\\right>$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, great! We now know qualitatively what this transformation means from a quantum-physics perspective, and more relevantly, what eigenvalues to expect (just the energy eigenvalues of hydrogen exponentiated). Therefore, we know value of $\\phi$ to expect. $$2i\\pi\\phi = -iEt \\implies \\phi = -\\frac{Et}{2\\pi}$$ We will obtain $\\phi$ using the IPEA, and we will obviously know how much time we give the system to evolve, thereby obtaining $t$. If you don't know what 2 and $\\pi$ are, then I suggest you stop reading right now...\n",

    "The next function, as the name once again suggests, performs the IPEA algorithm. The above function just performed one iteration, and as you can see in the body of this function, there is a `for` loop in which `buildControlledHam` is called, which implies that one iteration of this `for` loop represents one iteration of the IPEA. The `for` loop iterates `tot_num_iter` times (the input of the function). This tells us that the input `tot_num_iter` of the function signifies the number of iterations in the IPEA algorithm. The `IPEA` function does its iterations, and in each iteration, it is basically just creating the quantum circuit with the ancilla and $\\left|01\\right>$ initial state, doing what it needs to do (the bullet points above) to the circuit, running the circuit, recovering the result (the $\\phi_k$ for that iteration), and appending it to the `bits` list.
